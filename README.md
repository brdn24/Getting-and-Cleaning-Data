# README.md

This is the README of run_analysis.R file. 

The working directory of this file is checked upon running the file. However, changes to the first line is needed so that it can work correctly. 

The file does the following:
- merges the training and test data sets to create one single data set.
- extracts only the measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- and lastly, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
